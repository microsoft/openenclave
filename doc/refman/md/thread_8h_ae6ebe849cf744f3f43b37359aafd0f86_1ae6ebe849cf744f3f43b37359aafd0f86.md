## Syntax

    oe_result_t oe_cond_broadcast(oe_cond_t *cond)
## Description 

A thread calls this function to signal all threads waiting on the given condition variable. Waiting threads call [oe_cond_wait()](thread_8h_ad797958c67eb617187c17b09d35e810b_1ad797958c67eb617187c17b09d35e810b.md), which places them on a first-come first-served (FCFS) queue, where they wait to be signaled. [oe_cond_broadcast()](thread_8h_ae6ebe849cf744f3f43b37359aafd0f86_1ae6ebe849cf744f3f43b37359aafd0f86.md) wakes up all threads on the queue, causing them to return from [oe_cond_wait()](thread_8h_ad797958c67eb617187c17b09d35e810b_1ad797958c67eb617187c17b09d35e810b.md).
