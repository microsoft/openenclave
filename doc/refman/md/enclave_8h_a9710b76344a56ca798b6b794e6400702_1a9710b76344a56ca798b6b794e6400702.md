# OE_HostRealloc()

Reallocate bytes from the host's heap.

## Syntax

    void * OE_HostRealloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
## Description 

This function changes the size of the memory block pointed to by **ptr** on the host's heap to **size** bytes. The memory block may be moved to a new location, which is returned by this function. The implementation performs an OCALL to the host, which calls realloc(). To free the memory, it must be passed to [OE_HostFree()](enclave_8h_af7ed072613e44809e1991f4f64c63b23_1af7ed072613e44809e1991f4f64c63b23.md).



## Parameters

#### ptr

The memory block to change the size of. If NULL, this method allocates **size** bytes as if OE_HostMalloc was invoked. If not NULL, it should be a pointer returned by a previous call to OE_HostCalloc, OE_HostMalloc or OE_HostRealloc.

#### size

The number of bytes to be allocated. If 0, this method deallocates the memory at **ptr**. If the new size is larger, the value of the memory in the new allocated range is indeterminate.

## Returns

The pointer to the reallocated memory or NULL if **ptr** was freed by setting **size** to 0. This method also returns NULL if it was unable to reallocate the memory, in which case the original **ptr** remains valid and its contents are unchanged.
