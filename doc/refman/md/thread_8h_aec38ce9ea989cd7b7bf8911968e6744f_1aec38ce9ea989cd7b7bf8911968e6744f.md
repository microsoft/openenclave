# OE_CondSignal()

Signal a thread waiting on a condition variable.

## Syntax

    int OE_CondSignal(OE_Cond *cond)
## Description 

A thread calls this function to signal the next thread waiting on the given condition variable. Waiting threads call [OE_CondWait()](thread_8h_a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136_1a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136.md) which places them on on a first-come first-served (FCFS) queue, where they wait to be signaled. [OE_CondSignal()](thread_8h_aec38ce9ea989cd7b7bf8911968e6744f_1aec38ce9ea989cd7b7bf8911968e6744f.md) wakes up the thread at the front of queue, causing it to return from [OE_CondWait()](thread_8h_a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136_1a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136.md).

In enclaves, this function performs an OCALL, where it wakes the next waiting thread.
