# OE_CondWait()

Waits on a condition variable.

## Syntax

    int OE_CondWait(OE_Cond *cond, OE_Mutex *mutex)
## Description 

A thread calls this function to wait on a condition variable. If the condition variable is available, [OE_CondWait()](thread_8h_a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136_1a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136.md) returns immediately. Otherwise, the thread is placed on a first-come first-served (FCFS) queue where it waits to be signaled. The **mutex** parameter is used to synchronize access to the condition variable. The caller locks this mutex before calling [OE_CondWait()](thread_8h_a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136_1a681a086a647cf9d4af673b130e011136.md), which places the thread on the waiting queue and unlocks the mutex. When the thread is signaled by [OE_CondSignal()](thread_8h_aec38ce9ea989cd7b7bf8911968e6744f_1aec38ce9ea989cd7b7bf8911968e6744f.md), the waiting thread acquires the mutex and returns.

In enclaves, this function performs an OCALL, where the thread waits to be signaled.



## Parameters

#### cond

Wait on this condition variable.

#### mutex

This mutex must be locked by the caller.

## Returns

Returns zero on success.
