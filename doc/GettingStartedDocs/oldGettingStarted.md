Getting Started with Open Enclave
================================

Introduction
------------

This document provides a step-by-step tutorial to begin using the Open Enclave
SDK. It explains how to obtain, build, and install the SDK. It also describes
how to develop and build a few simple enclave applications.

For information on getting started using experimental support for Windows, see
[Getting Started on Windows](GettingStarted.Windows.md).

Licenses
--------

Microsoft plans to release the Open Enclave SDK under the MIT license, included
here in the source distribution.

<https://github.com/Microsoft/openenclave/blob/master/LICENSE>

Open Enclave builds on various third-party packages. It modifies and
redistributes libunwind and in addition downloads other third-party packages
on-the-fly during the build process. Licensing details for all third-party
packages shown in the table below.

Obtaining the source distribution
---------------------------------

Open Enclave is available from GitHub. Use the following command to download
the source distribution.

```
# git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/openenclave
```

This creates a source tree under the directory called openenclave.


Quick Start
-----------

If you wish to skip ahead to the section on developing a simple enclave, you
can follow the instructions below to set up a working environment. If you want
more details on prerequisites, building or installing, refer to the subsequent
sections that discussing each topic individually.

### Prerequisites

Execute the following commands from the root of the source tree to install the
prerequisites (required packages, the SGX driver, and the SGX library
dependencies).

_For Skylake and Kabylake systems (SGX-1):_

- Intel(R) SGX driver
- Intel(R) AESM service

```
$ sudo ./scripts/install-prereqs
$ sudo make -C prereqs
$ sudo make -C prereqs install
```

_For Coffeelake systems (SGX-1 with Flexible Launch Control):_

- Intel(R) SGX driver with FLC support
- Intel(R) NGSA SDK

```
$ sudo ./scripts/install-prereqs
$ sudo make -C prereqs USE_LIBSGX=1
$ sudo make -C prereqs install USE_LIBSGX=1
```

The second and third commands are only necessary if you wish to install the
listed Intel(R) SGX drivers or library dependencies. Open Enclave can be used in
simulation mode without these components.

Also note that the two sets of Intel(R) drivers and libraries are *not*
compatible with each other and both should not be installed at the same time.

### Building

Build is generally out-of-tree (in-tree is possible, though not recommended).
To build, pick a directory to build under ("*build/*" below). Then use cmake to configure
the build and generate the out-of-tree make files and build.

_For Skylake and Kabylake systems (SGX-1):_
```
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
build$ cmake ..
build$ make
```

_For Coffeelake systems (SGX-1 with Flexible Launch Control):_
```
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
build$ cmake .. -DUSE_LIBSGX=1
build$ make
```

### Installing

As of now, there is no real need to install the SDK system-wide, so you might
use a tree in your home directory:

```
build$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=~/openenclave ..
build$ make install
```

Prerequisites
-------------

The following are prerequisites for building and running Open Enclave.

- Intel® X86-64bit architecture with SGX1 or SGX2
- Ubuntu Desktop-16.04-LTS 64bits
- Various packages: build-essential, ocaml, automake, autoconf, libtool, wget, python, libssl-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev, protobuf-compiler, libprotobuf-dev, build-essential, python, libssl-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev, libprotobuf-dev, uuid-dev, libxml2-dev, cmake, pkg-config
- Intel® SGX Driver (/dev/isgx)
- Intel® SGX AESM Service (from the Intel® SGX SDK)

Once Linux and the various packages are installed, it is necessary to install
the SGX driver and the SGX AESM service. These can be obtained from the
following GitHub repositories.

- <https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx-driver>
- <https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx>

Both contain detailed instructions about building and installing these pieces.
As a convenience, Open Enclave provides a script for downloading, building and
installing both the driver and the AESM service. From the root of the
Open Enclave source tree, type the following command:

```
$ sudo make -C prereqs
$ sudo make -C prereqs install
```

After this completes, verify that the AESM service is running as follows.

```
$ service aesmd status
```

Look for the string “active (running)”, usually highlighted in green.


Building
--------

Build is generally out-of-tree (in-tree is possible, though not recommended).
To build, pick a directory to build under ("*build/*" below).

```
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
```

Configure with

```
build$ cmake ..
```

In addition to the standard CMake variables, the following CMake variables
control the behavior of the Linux make generator for Open Enclave:

| Variable                 | Description                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE         | Build configuration (*Debug*, *Release*, *RelWithDebInfo*). Default is *Debug*. |
| ENABLE_FULL_LIBC_TESTS   | Enable full Libc tests. Default is disabled, enable with setting to "On", "1", ... |
| ENABLE_FULL_LIBCXX_TESTS | Enable full Libc++ tests. Default is disabled, enable with setting to "On", "1", ... |
| ENABLE_REFMAN            | Enable building of reference manual. Requires Doxygen to be installed. Default is enabled, disable with setting to "Off", "No", "0", ... |


E.g., to generate an optimized release-build with debug info, use

```
 build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=relwithdebinfo
````

Multiple variables can be defined at the call with multiple "-D*Var*=*Value*" arguments.

Once configured, build with

```
build$ make
```

This builds the entire Open Enclave SDK, creating the following files.

| Filename                          | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| output/bin/oegen                  | Utility for generating ECALL and OCALL stubs from IDL |
| output/bin/oesign                 | Utility for signing enclaves                          |
| output/lib/enclave/liboecore.a    | Core library for building enclave applications (defines enclave intrinsics) |
| output/lib/enclave/liboeenclave.a | Enclave library for building enclave applications (defines enclave features) |
| output/lib/enclave/liboelibc.a    | C runtime library for enclave                         |
| output/lib/enclave/liboelibcxx.a  | C++ runtime library for enclave                       |
| output/lib/host/liboehost.a       | Library for building host applications                |
| output/share/doc/openenclave/     | HTML API reference for Open Enclave                    |

If things break, set the **VERBOSE** make variable to print all invoked commands.

```
build$ make VERBOSE=1
```

Building from within a subtree of the build-tree builds all dependencies for that directory as well.
"**make clean**" is handy before a spot-rebuild in verbose mode.

A successful build only outputs the HTML API reference into the build-tree. To update the refman *.md-files
in the source-tree, use

```
build$ make refman-source
```


Testing
-------

After everything has been built, execute the tests via **ctest** (see "**man ctest**" for details).

```
build$ ctest
```

To run the tests in simulation mode, use

```
build$ OE_SIMULATION=1 ctest
```

If things fail, "**ctest -V**" provides test details. Executing ctest from a sub-dir executes the tests underneath.

Only a small subset of libc/libcxx tests are enabled by default due to their huge
cost on building (5/30mins+). Enable the full set by setting the corresponding cmake variable
**ENABLE_FULL_LIBC_TESTS/ENABLE_FULL_LIBCXX_TESTS** before building.

```
build$ cmake -DENABLE_FULL_LIBC_TESTS=ON -DENABLE_FULL_LIBCXX_TESTS=ON ..
build$ make
```

To run valgrind-tests, add "**-D ExperimentalMemCheck**" to the ctest call.
Enclave tests all seem to fail today, though this succeeds:

```
build$ ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck -R oeelf
```

Installing
----------

This chapter describes how to locally install the SDK from the compiled
Open Enclave tree. To create a redistributable binary package (such as a .deb
package), see the next chapter.

Specify the install-prefix to the cmake call. As of now, there is no real need
to install the SDK system-wide, so you might use a tree in your home directory:

```
build$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=~/openenclave ..
build$ make install
```

If you want the SDK tools to be available to all users and headers/libs
available from a system default location, you may opt to install system-wide.
This naturally requires root privileges. Note that there is no uninstall
script (we target an rpm/deb-based SDK install in the future), hence we
recommend overwriting the default (/usr/local/) with a singular tree.

```
build$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/openenclave ..
build$ sudo make install
```

On Linux, there is also the **DESTDIR** mechanism, prepending the install prefix
with the given path:
```
build$ make install DESTDIR=foo
```

The following table shows where key components are installed.

| Path                                     | Description                     |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| <install_prefix>/bin                     | Programs                        |
| <install_prefix>/include/openenclave     | Includes                        |
| <install_prefix>/lib/openenclave/enclave | Enclave libraries               |
| <install_prefix>/lib/openenclave/host    | Host libraries                  |
| <install_prefix>/lib/openenclave/debugger| Debugger libraries              |
| <install_prefix>/share/doc/openenclave   | Documentation                   |
| <install_prefix>/share/openenclave       | Samples and make/cmake-includes |

For *Makefile* based projects, you may use the make-include in
**<install_prefix>/share/openenclave/config.mak** in your own project for
sourcing variables containing version info and SDK install paths.

For *CMake* based projets, you may use the cmake-include in
**<install_prefix>/share/openenclave/openenclave.cmake** in your own project.
It provides the following taregets (e.g., for inclusion in
**target_link_libraries**) to set the required compiler flags, include dirs,
and libraries.

| Target           | Description                                                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| oecore           | Enclave code: Open Enclave core features. Must be present in all enclave code. |
| oeenclave        | Enclave code: Open Enclave features. These features may depend on the mbedcrypto and oelibc libraries. |
| oelibc           | Enclave code: Open Enclave C library. Includes oecore.                            |
| oelibcxx         | Enclave code: Open Enclave C++ library. Includes oelibc.                             |
| oeidl            | Enclave code: Misc helpers required with IDL-compiled code. Includes oelibc.        |
| oehost           | Host code: Open Enclave intrinsic functions.                                         |
| oehostapp        | Host code: Must be present with host binary for proper linker flags.                |
| oesign           | Build: shorthand for the signing tool executable.                                   |
| oegen            | Build: shorthand for the IDL compiler executable.                                   |

Create Redistributable SDK pacakge
----------------------------------

To create a redistributable package (deb, rpm, ...), use **cpack**. Specify
the final installation prefix to cmake using the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable
as above. E.g., to create a debian package that will install the SDK to
/opt/openenclave, use:

```
build$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/openenclave ..
build$ cpack -G DEB
```

Samples
-------

Find the samples under **share/openenclave/samples/** of the installation.

Change to the new samples directory and build and run the samples.

```
$ cd ~/openenclave/share/openenclave/samples
$ sh test-samples.sh
```

If these samples run without an error, then Open Enclave is installed and working correctly.


Developing a simple enclave (echo)
----------------------------------

This chapter shows how to develop a simple enclave called echo. The next
chapter explains how to use this enclave in a host application. This example
is included in the installed samples directory (see
\<install_prefix\>/openenclave/share/openenclave/samples/cmake/hello/).

### The ECALL

The echo enclave implements a single ECALL named EnclaveEcho(), which is
called by the host (in the next chapter). This function has the following
signature.

```
OE_ECALL void EnclaveEcho(void* args);
```

The args parameter can be whatever the host and the enclave agree on. In this
case args is a pointer to a zero-terminated string in host memory. The
OE_ECALL macro exports the function and injects it into a special section
(.ecall) in the ELF image. When the host loads the enclave, it builds a table
of all ECALLs exported by the enclave.

### The Echo enclave Listing

Here’s the full listing for the echo enclave (enc/enc.c):

```
#include <openenclave/enclave.h>

OE_ECALL void EnclaveEcho(void* args)
{
    oe_call_host("HostEcho", args);
}
```

Notice EnclaveEcho() performs an OCALL, calling the host’s HostEcho()
function with the same arguments.

### Enclave build collateral

The samples provides cmake helper includes under samples/cmake/cmake/
simplifying Open Enclave application writing. **add_enclave_executable.cmake**
provides the **add_enclave_executable()** function. It extends CMake's
**add_executable()** by adding the intrinsic target (oecore) and also
signing the enclave. For the echo sample, this ***CMakeLists.txt*** suffices:

```
include(add_enclave_executable)
add_enclave_executable(samples-echoenc echo.conf private.pem
    enc.c
    )
```

The **echo.conf** argument is the name of a configuration file that defines
enclave settings, such as stack size, heap size, and the maximum number of
threads (TCSs). Here is the echo sample:

```
# echo.conf
Debug=1
NumHeapPages=1024
NumStackPages=1024
NumTCS=2
ProductID=1
SecurityVersion=1
```

The **private.pem** argument is a private RSA key used to sign the enclave,
here included with the sample. To generate a self-signed private key yourself,
use OpenSSL as follows.

```
# openssl genrsa -out private.pem -3 3072
```

Then the public key can be generated from this key as follows.

```
# openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

Developing a simple host (echohost)
-----------------------------------

Next, we develop a host to run the echoenc.signed.so enclave that we developed
in the previous chapter. The listing from samples/cmake/echo/host follows.

```
#include <openenclave/host.h>
#include <stdio.h>

OE_OCALL void HostEcho(void* args)
{
    if (args)
    {
        const char* str = (const char*)args;
        printf("%s\n", str);
    }
}

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
    oe_result_t result;
    oe_enclave_t* enclave = NULL;

    if (argc != 2)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s ENCLAVE_PATH\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    result = oe_create_enclave(
        argv[1],
        OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_SGX,
        OE_ENCLAVE_FLAG_DEBUG,
        NULL,
        0,
        &enclave);

    if (result != OE_OK)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s: oe_create_enclave(): %u\n", argv[0], result);
        return 1;
    }

    result = oe_call_enclave(enclave, "EnclaveEcho", "Hello");
    if (result != OE_OK)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s: oe_call_enclave(): %u\n", argv[0], result);
        return 1;
    }

    oe_terminate_enclave(enclave);

    return 0;
}
```

This host performs the following tasks:

- Defines an OCALL: HostEcho()
- Instantiates an enclave: oe_create_enclave()
- Calls into the enclave: oe_call_enclave()
- Terminates the enclave: oe_terminate_enclave()

### Host build collateral

The ***CMakeLists.txt*** is rather straight-forward, though note the
**oehostapp** link target in the add_executable() call:

```
add_executable(samples-echohost host.c)
target_link_libraries(samples-echohost oehostapp)
```

The additional target instructs CMake to provide the open enclave includes and
host libraries (via oehost), as well as the proper linker flags for the host
OCall targets to be resolved.

Completing the echo sample
--------------------------

In the project file **samples/cmake/CMakeLists.txt**, note the line:
```
include(${OE_PREFIX}/share/openenclave/openenclave.cmake)
```

This sources the CMake include providing the Open Enclave targets.

Build the samples, e.g. in a subdirectory under samples/cmake:
```
samples/cmake$ mkdir build && cd build
samples/cmake/build$ cmake .. -DOE_PREFIX=../../../.. && make
```

After building, we are ready to run the samples:

```
samples/cmake/build$ ctest
```

------------------------------------------------

Other build systems
-------------------

If you are not using CMake for your project, the Makefile samples under
***samples/make/*** provide guidance on the necessary includes, libraries, and
flag definitions.

Specifically, the Open Enclave includes for the intrinsics are located under
<PREFIX>/include/openenclave (or via the **OE_INCLUDEDIR** make variable when
using the make include installed under <PREFIX>/share/openenclave/config.mak).

Necessary gcc compiler flags for enclave code are:
```
CFLAGS=-nostdinc -fPIC
```

Necessary gcc linker flags for an enclave are:
```
LDFLAGS=\
    -nostdlib \
    -nodefaultlibs \
    -nostartfiles \
    -Wl,--no-undefined \
    -Wl,-Bstatic \
    -Wl,-Bsymbolic \
    -Wl,--export-dynamic \
    -Wl,-pie \
```

The entry point for the enclave image is **_start()**. The linker stores 
the virtual address of the **_start()** function in the ELF header 
(Elf64_Ehdr.e_entry) of the resulting image. When the enclave is instantiated 
by the host, this entry point is copied to each TCS (Thread Control Structure) 
in the image. When the host invokes the SGX EENTER instruction on a TCS, the 
hardware fetches the entry point from the TCS and jumps to that address and 
the **_start()** function begins to execute.

The necessary enclave library contains the enclave intrinsics, including the
_start() entry point. Note that the echo sample uses neither a C nor C++
runtime library. Other samples will show how these are used.

```
LIBRARIES = -L${OE_LIBDIR}/openenclave/enclave -loecore
```

To sign the enclave, use the **oesign** tool. This tool takes the following
parameters.

```
$ oesign

Usage: oesign ENCLAVE CONFFILE KEYFILE
```

The CONFFILE argument is the name of a configuration file that defines enclave
settings, and the KEYFILE argument is a private RSA key used to sign the
enclave. See the CMake section for details on these files.


### Debugging the enclave

We can't use GDB directly to debug enclave application since it doesn't understand enclave yet.
Open Enclave includes a GDB plugin to help developers to debug enclaves that is developed using this SDK.

Note: the enclave must be created with debug opt-in flag, otherwise debugger can't work since it can't read the enclave memory.
The default sample enclave is created with debug flag, refer to:

```
result = oe_create_enclave(
        argv[1],
        OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_SGX,
        OE_ENCLAVE_FLAG_DEBUG,
        NULL,
        0,
        &enclave);
```

This flag (OE_ENCLAVE_FLAG_DEBUG) should only be set in development phase. It needs to be removed for a production enclave.

The debugger is installed at <install_prefix>/bin/oe-gdb. The usage is same with GDB, for example: the following command will
launch the simple enclave application under debugger:

```
# /opt/openenclave/bin/oe-gdb -arg ./host/echohost ./enc/echoenc.signed.so
```

After the enclave application is loaded, you can use b to set breakpoint, bt to check stack etc.
