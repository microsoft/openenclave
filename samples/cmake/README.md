samples/cmake
=============

This directory contains Open Enclave samples for cmake.
After installing Open Enclave, use the standard cmake
build flow. Specify the install prefix in the OE_PREFIX
cmake variable so the Open Enclave targets can be located.

To test the samples, use ctest from the build dir.
