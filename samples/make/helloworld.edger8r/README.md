## About the helloworld sample

This sample is about as simple as you can get whereby the host calls in to the enclave calling a function with no parameters, and then the enclave calls back into the host calling another function with no parameters. A little message is printed in both of these functions to help show the progression through the code.

This sample uses the SDK edger8r to generate the code necessary for the host to call the enclave function, as well as generate the code necessary for the enclave to call the host function. To achieve this we need to author an `edl` file and generate these files. The following is the contents of the helloworld.edl file that is in the root of this sample:

```edl
enclave {
    trusted {
        public void enclave_helloworld();

    };

    untrusted {
        void host_helloworld();
    };
};
```

This file generates two function stubs, one for the function that lives in the enclave called `enclave_helloworld()` and one for the function that lives in the host called `host_helloworld()`. In this case the functions do not take any parameters as well as not returning anything. Other samples will cover the parameters in more details.

The generated files are created by calling the following:
```bash 
edger8r helloworld.edl --untrusted-dir host --trusted-dir enc
```

This command compiles the helloworld.edl file and generates the following files:

| file | description |
|---|---|
| enc/helloworld_args.h | Defines the parameters that are passed to both functions in the enclave and host |
| enc/helloworld_t.c | Contains a proxy implementation of the untrusted function that calls into the host itself |
| enc/helloworld_t.h | Defines the function prototypes of the untrusted host functions|
| host/helloworld_args.h | Defines the parameters that are passed to both functions in the enclave and host |
| host/helloworld_t.c | Contains a proxy implementation of the trusted function that calls into the enclave itself |
| host/helloworld_t.h | Defines the function prototypes of the trusted enclave functions |

Note that `helloworld_args.h` in both directories are actually the same file.

The Makefile in the root of this sample directory has three rules

- build: Generates the files from the edl, builds the enclave code, and followed builds the host code
- clean: Deletes all temporary files generated during the build
- run: Runs the host, passing in the signed enclave shared library

```make
OPENENCLAVE_CONFIG=../config.mak
include $(OPENENCLAVE_CONFIG)

build:
        $(OE_BINDIR)/oeedger8r helloworld.edl --untrusted-dir host --trusted-dir enc
        $(MAKE) -C enc
        $(MAKE) -C host

clean:
        $(MAKE) -C enc clean
        $(MAKE) -C host clean

run:
        host/helloworldhost ./enc/helloworldenc.signed.so
```

Build the project as follows:

```bash
make build
```

Clean the project as follows:

```bash
make clean
```

Run the built sample as follows:

```bash
make run
```

## Enclave component
  
This section shows how to develop and build a simple enclave called helloworld.
  
### Develop an enclave
  
An enclave exposes its functionality to the host application in the form of a set of trusted methods that are defined in the `helloworld.edl` file and implemented in within the enclave project.

The helloworld sample implements a single function named `enclave_helloworld` which is called by the host. All it does is print out a message and then call back to host. No parameters are passed in this sample for simplicity.

The full source for the enclave implementation is here: [helloworld.eder8r/enc/enc.c](/samples/make/helloworld.edger8r/enc/enc.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Include the trusted helloworld header that is generated
// during the build. This file is generated by calling the
// sdk tool oeedger8r against the helloworld.edl file.
#include "helloworld_t.h"

// This is the function that the host calls. It prints
// a message in the enclave before calling back out to
// the host to print a message from there too.
void enclave_helloworld()
{
    // Print a message from the enclave. Note that this
    // does not directly call fprintf, but calls into the
    // host and calls fprintf from there. This is because
    // the fprintf function is not part of the enclave
    // as it requires support from the kernel.
    fprintf(stdout, "Hello world from the enclave\n");

    // Call back into the host
    host_helloworld();
}
```

Each line will now be described in turn.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

An enclave library will be loaded into and run inside a host application which is a user-mode process. To keep the [Trusted computing base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base) small, the decision was made to make only a specific set of APIs available to an enclave library. A complete list of APIs available to an enclave library can be found [here](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/APIsAvaiableToEnclave.md#apis-available-to-an-enclave-library)
  
The `stdio.h` header file is included in this sample because we are calling the CRT function `fprintf` to print a message on the screen. However this function has a dependency on the kernel to print a message on the screen so this code cannot execute within the enclave itself. Instead this function is a proxy function that calls through to the host to carry out the call on the enclaves behalf. Only a subset of the CRT is made available through this proxy library.

 ```c
void enclave_helloworld()
```

An enclave exposes its functionality via a set of methods defined in the `helloworld.edl` file and implemented here. The only implemented function in the enclave in this sample is `enclave_helloworld`.

```c
fprintf(stdout, "Hello world from the enclave\n");
```

As described above when the `stdio.h` header file was included, this is a call to print a message on the screen. As we are in the enclave this function is implemented as a proxy function in the SDK enclave libraries which call into the host to carry out the actual `fprintf` call.

```c
host_helloworld();
```

This calls the proxy function that was generated from the `helloworld.edl` file which in turn calls into the function within the host.

### Build and sign an enclave

As mentioned in [how-to-build-and-run-samples](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/sampedocs/README.md#how-to-build-and-run-samples), make files were provided for each sample, you can build the helloworld enclave by running `make build` inside the `enc` directory, or build the enclave and host code by running `make build` from the sample root directory. Note that you will need to run the `make build` from the sample root directory anyway in order to generate the proxy and header files from the `helloworld.edl` file.

The following enclave files come with the sample:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enc.c | Source code for the enclave `enclave_helloworld` function |
| Makefile | Makefile used to build the enclave |

The following files are generated during the build.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enc.o | Compiled source file |
| helloworld_args.h | generated arguments header file from `helloworld.edl` |
| helloworld.conf |  |
| helloworldenc.signed.so | signed version of the enclave shared library |
| helloworldenc.so | built and linked enclave shared library |
| helloworld_t.c | generated proxy source file for trusted code from `helloworld.edl` |
| helloworld_t.h | generated proxy header file trusted code from `helloworld.edl` |
| helloworld_t.o | compiled proxy source file |
| private.pem | generated signature used for signing the shared library |
| public.pem | generated signature used for signing the shared library |

Only the signed version of the enclave `helloworldenc.signed.so` is loadable on Linux as enclaves are required to be digitally signed.

#### Under the hood for the `make build` operation

Here is a listing of key components in the helloworld/enc/Makefile. [complete listing](/samples/make/helloworld/enc/Makefile)

keys:
        openssl genrsa -out private.pem -3 3072
        openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
 ```

##### Build

The Makefile's `build` target is for compiling enclave source code and linking its library with its dependent libraries (in the following order):

- oeenclave
- mbedx509
- mbedcrypto
- oelibc
- oecore

`helloworldenc.so` is the resulting enclave library (unsigned)

##### Sign

The OE SDK comes with a signing tool called `oesign` for digitally signing an enclave library. Run `oesign --help` for the usage. For this sample we use the `openssl` command in the `keys` rule to generate the signature, then we sign with the `oesign` tool using the generated signatures.

The signing process also reads the `helloworld.conf` file which describes important parameters associated with with enclave.

```conf
Debug=1
NumHeapPages=1024
NumStackPages=1024
NumTCS=1
ProductID=1
SecurityVersion=1
```

These parameters are described in the [Getting started Build And Sign](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/sampledocs/buildandsign.md#signing-the-enclave) document.

## Host Application

The host process is what drives the enclave app. It is responsible for managing the lifetime of the enclave and invoking enclave methods but should be considered an untrusted component that is never allowed to handle plaintext secrets intended for the enclave.

In this section we will cover how to develop a host to load and run the helloworld enclave we built above.

### Develop a host

There are relatively fewer restrictions on developing a host application compared to authoring an enclave. In general, you are free to link your choice of additional libraries into the host application. A part of a typical host application job is to manage the life cycle of an enclave. Open Enclave SDK provides [Enclave Host Runtime](/docs/GettingStartedDocs/APIsAvaiableToEnclave.md#enclave-host-library) for enclave management.

The full source for the host implementation is here: [helloworld.edger8r/host/host.c](/samples/make/helloworld.edger8r/host/host.c)

```c
#include <openenclave/host.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Include the untrusted helloworld header that is generated
// during the build. This file is generated by calling the 
// sdk tool oeedger8r against the helloworld.edl file.
#include "helloworld_u.h"

// This is the function that the enclave will call back into to
// print a message.
void host_helloworld()
{
    fprintf(stdout, "Enclave called into host to print: Hello World!\n");
}

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
    oe_result_t result;
    int ret = 1;
    oe_enclave_t* enclave = NULL;

    if (argc != 2)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s enclave_image_path\n", argv[0]);
        goto exit;
    }

    // Create the enclave
    result = oe_create_enclave(
        argv[1], OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_SGX, OE_ENCLAVE_FLAG_DEBUG, NULL, 0, &enclave);
    if (result != OE_OK)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "oe_create_enclave(): result=%u", result);
        goto exit;
    }

    // Call into the enclave
    enclave_helloworld(enclave);

    ret = 0;

exit:
    //Clean up the enclave if we created one
    if (enclave)
        oe_terminate_enclave(enclave);

    return ret;
}
```

Each line will now be described in turn.

```c
#include <openenclave/host.h>
```

Includes the header for the open enclave functions used in this file, including `oe_create_enclave` and `oe_terminate_enclave`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

Includes the standard CRT libraries. Unlike the enclave implementation that includes a special enclave proxy version of the stdio library, the host is not protected and so uses all the normal C libraries and functions.

```c
void host_helloworld()
{
    fprintf(stdout, "Enclave called into host to print: Hello World!\n");
}
```

This is the actual host function that the enclave calls in to. The function is defined in the `helloworld.edl` file and implemented here.

```c
int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
```

The host is the application that creates and calls into the enclave so this host is a normal C executable with a standard `main` function.

```c
    result = oe_create_enclave(
        argv[1], OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_SGX, OE_ENCLAVE_FLAG_DEBUG, NULL, 0, &enclave);
```

This function sets up the enclave environment for the target enclave library including allocating resource, validating enclave library, creating enclave instance, and loading the enclave library.

The helloworld sample creates an enclave by calling `oe_create_enclave` with the path to the signed enclave library file which happens to be passed as the first parameter to the launching application. You can optionally specify OE_ENCLAVE_FLAG_DEBUG if you want to debug an enclave.

On a successful creation it returns an opaque enclave handle for any future operation on the enclave

Note: - You can create multiple enclave instances this way if there is remaining enclave resource available. such as Enclave Page Cache (EPC).

```c
    enclave_helloworld(enclave);
```

This function calls into the generated host proxy function that was generated from the `helloworld.edl` file. It handles the code that marshals any parameters and calls the function within in the enclave itself. In this sample we do not have any actual function parameters.

The Open Enclave handles all the context switching between the host mode and the enclave mode.

```c
oe_terminate_enclave
```

Terminates the enclave and frees up all associated resources associated with it.

### Build a host

The helloworld sample comes with a Makefile with a `build` target. You can run `make build` to build host app. Note that all generated files are created from the makefile in the root of the sample and needs to be run before building can happen in the host directory itself.

| host.c | Source code for the host `host_helloworld` function, as well as the executable `main` function. |
| Makefile | Makefile used to build the host |

The following files are generated during the build.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| host.o | Compiled host source file |
| helloworld_args.h | generated arguments header file from `helloworld.edl` |
| helloworldhost | built and linked host executable |

# How to Run

You can run the helloworld sample directly on the command line as follows:

```bash
host/helloworldhost ./enc/helloworldenc.signed.so
```

Or execute `make run` from the root of the sample:

```bash
$ make run
host/helloworldhost ./enc/helloworldenc.signed.so
Hello world from the enclave
Enclave called into host to print: Hello World!
```
