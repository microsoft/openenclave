 * Creates an enclave from an enclave image file.
 *
 * This function creates an enclave from an enclave image file. While creating
 * the enclave, this function interacts with the Intel(R) SGX drviver and the
 * Intel(R) AESM service. Enclave creation peforms the following steps.
 *     - Loads an enclave image file
 *     - Maps the enclave memory image onto the driver device (/dev/isgx)
 *     - Lays out the enclave memory image and injects metadata
 *     - Asks the driver to create the enclave (ECREATE)
 *     - Asks the driver to add the pages to the EPC (EADD/EEXTEND)
 *     - Asks the Intel(R) launch enclave (LE) for a launch token (EINITKEY)
 *     - Asks the driver to initialize the enclave with the token (EINIT)
 *
 * Once these steps have been performed, the enclave is ready to use.
 *
 * @param path The path of an enclave image file in ELF-64 format. This
 * file must have been linked with the **oeenclave** library and signed by the
 * **oesign** tool.
 *
 * @param flags These flags control how the enclave is run.
 *     - OE_FLAG_DEBUG - runs the enclave in debug mode
 *     - OE_FLAG_SIMULATION - runs the enclave in simulation mode
 *
 * @param enclave This points to the enclave instance upon succeess.
 *
 * @returns Returns OE_OK on success.
