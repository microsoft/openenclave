Microsoft(R) OpenEnclave SDK
============================

# OpenEnclave

Introduction
------------

OpenEnclave is an SDK for building enclave applications in C and C++. An
enclave application partitions itself into an untrusted component (called the
host) and a trusted component (called the enclave). An enclave is a secure
container whose memory is protected from entities outside the enclave. These
protections allow enclaves to perform secure computations with assurances that
secrets will not be compromised.

The current implementation of OpenEnclave is built on the Intel Software Guard
Extensions (SGX), although OpenEnclave may support other memory protection
architectures in the future, such as Microsoft Virtual Secure Mode.

Documentation
-------------

The OpenEnclave project provides the following documents.

- [Getting Started with OpenEnclave](doc/GettingStarted.md)

- [Open Enclave Function Reference](doc/refman/md/index.md)

- [OpenEnclave Design Overview](doc/DesignOverview.pdf)

The first document explains how to build and use OpenEnclave.

Installing
----------

This section explains briefly how to install the OpenEnclave SDK from source.
For a detailed explanation, see [Getting Started with
OpenEnclave](doc/GettingStarted.md).

### Prerequisites

OpenEnclave runs on the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 16.04-LTS 64-bits

It supports two modes: **SGX mode** and **simulation mode**.

**Simulation mode** has package dependencies that may be installed from
the root of the source distribution as follows.

```
$ sudo ./scripts/install-prereqs
```

**SGX mode** has the following prerequisites.

- SGX-1 hardware support
- Intel(R) SGX driver
- Intel(R) AESM service
- Various package dependencies

To install these prerequisites type the following commands from the root of
the source distribution.

```
$ sudo ./scripts/install-prereqs
$ sudo make -C prereqs
$ sudo make -C prereqs install
```

### Building

Build is generally out-of-tree (in-tree is possible, though not recommended).
To build, pick a directory to build under ("build/" below). Then use cmake to configure
the build and generate the out-of-tree make files and build.

```
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
build$ cmake ..
build$ make
```

### Running the tests

After building, tests can be executed via ctest, see "man ctest" for details.

For SGX mode, type:

```
build$ ctest
```

For simulation mode, type:

```
build$ OE_SIMULATION=1 ctest
```

### Installing

Specify the install-prefix to the cmake call. As of now, there is no real need to install the SDK
system-wide, so you might use a tree in your home directory:

```
build$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$~/openenclave ..
build$ make install
```

For more details on installation, such as how to create redistributable packages,
see the [Getting Started with OpenEnclave](doc/GettingStarted.md) doc.
