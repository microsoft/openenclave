====

This directory contains the sources for the LLDB python extension. That 
extension is used to load enclave symbol, enable enclave debugging, and 
stitch stacks etc. 

It will be loaded into lldb as a plugin. Please refer to 
https://lldb.llvm.org/python-reference.html for LLDB 
python extension model.
