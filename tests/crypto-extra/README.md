Additional Crypto API tests
===========================

==Preparing Test Data==

The certificates and CRLs were generated using the following openssl commands.

  1. Creating Root CA.
      1. openssl genrsa -out RootCA.key.pem
      2. openssl req -new -x509 -key RootCA.key.pem -out RootCA.crt.pem

  2. Creating Intermediate CA signed by the Root CA.
      1. openssl genrsa -out IntermediateCA.key.pem
      2. openssl req -new -key IntermediateCA.key.pem -out IntermediateCA.csr
      3. openssl x509 -req -in IntermediateCA.csr -CA RootCA.crt.pem -CAkey RootCA.key.pem -CAcreateserial -out IntermediateCA.crt.pem

  3. Creating Leaf certificate signed by the Intermediate CA.
      1. openssl genrsa -out Leaf.key.pem
      2. openssl req -new -key Leaf.key.pem -out Leaf.csr
      3. openssl x509 -req -in Leaf.csr -CA IntermediateCA.crt.pem -CAkey IntermediateCA.key.pem -CAcreateserial -out Leaf.crt.pem

  4. Setup CA index files and CRL numbers.
      1. touch root_index.txt
      2. touch intermediate_index.txt
      3. echo "00" > root_crl_number
      4. echo "00" > intermediate_crl_number

  5. Generating a root and intermediate CRLs
      1. openssl ca -gencrl -keyfile RootCA.key.pem -cert RootCA.crt.pem -out root_crl_n.pem -config root.cnf
      2. openssl ca -gencrl -keyfile IntermediateCA.key.pem -cert IntermediateCA.crt.pem -out intermediate_crl_n.pem -config intermediate.cnf

  6. Revoking intermediate and leaf certs.
      1. openssl ca -revoke IntermediateCA.crt.pem -keyfile RootCA.key.pem -cert RootCA.crt.pem -config root.cnf
      2. openssl ca -revoke Leaf.crt.pem -keyfile IntermediateCA.key.pem -cert IntermediateCA.crt.pem -config intermediate.cnf

  7. Converting crl from pem to der format.
      1. openssl crl -inform pem -outform der -in crl.pem -out crl.der
  
==List of Tests==

  1. test_cert_chain_positive
       Asserts the following condition: "In a valid cert chain, each certificate's issuer CA occurs atleast once after the certificate".
        Tests correct ordering, duplicates, two and three level chains.
  2. test_cert_chain_negative: Negative tests involving incorrect ordering, missing certs etc.
  3. test_crls.
      1. Assert that verify succeeds when no crls are passed.
      2. Assert that when crls are passed, but don't revoke certs, verify succeeds.
      3. Assert that when crl revoking leaf is passed, verify fails.
      4. Assert that when crl revoking intermediate is passed in, verify fails. (This behavior is currently broken.)
      5. Assert that when only one crl is passed in (either root or intermediate), verify fails. (This behavior is currently broken.)
